# 3D Printing of the energy harvester of the H-Hope project

The innovative technology for energy harvesting from hidden hydro sources, developed as part of the H-Hope project, has been intentionally designed to be accessible to users of all technical skill levels. The assembly process is straightforward, allowing individuals with minimal expertise to construct the device. Furthermore, the system is cost-effective, as it consists of 3D-printed components alongside a few metallic parts that are readily available at local stores. In this section, we provide a detailed Step-by-Step Guide for the 3D printing of these components.
&nbsp;

For the purpose of this guide, we will demonstrate the process using two professional-grade filament printers:  **a Bambu Lab X1 Carbon** printer and **a PRUSA MK3 printer**. Each printer comes along with a slicer software developed by the same company, i.e. **Bambu Studio** and **PRUSA Slicer**, respectively. However, it is important to emphasise that the same procedures can be followed with any 3D printer, including more affordable models. Moreover, both **Bambu Studio** and **PRUSA Slicer** supports slicing for a wide range of printer models from various vendors. This makes the software highly versatile and strongly recommended for use with different 3D printers. It is worth noting that both **PrusaSlicer** and **Bambu Studio** are quite similar in terms of functionality. They share many of the same symbols for their tools and also use similar terminology, making it easy to transition between the two programs. This compatibility allows users to switch from one software to the other smoothly, without needing to learn a completely new interface or workflow.  
- At the end of this tutorial, you will find a complete list of the files required for printing each component of the energy harvester. These files are also accessible in the **H-Hope Data Hub**, which can be found at the following site: **PLACE LINK HERE.**

**Importing an STL File into Bambu Studio and Generating a 3D Print File** 
The **Bambu Lab X1** printer is a versatile and powerful 3D printer, and using the **Bambu Studio** slicer allows you to prepare 3D models for printing efficiently. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of importing an STL file into Bambu Studio, configuring your print settings, and exporting the G-code file needed to print the object on a **Bambu Lab X1** printer.

What You’ll Need:
•	Bambu Studio (the slicer software from Bambu Lab). You can download it from: https://bambulab.com/en/download/studio.
•	STL files (the 3D model you want to print). You can find the stl files corresponding to all the printable components of the H-Hope harvester below in this page. 
•	Bambu Lab X1 printer
•	Bambu Lab filament or other compatible filament: For this specific project, PETG (Polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified) is an ideal choice when waterproofing is essential for the 3D-printed model. This filament provides excellent resistance to both water and moisture, creating an effective barrier, and it is also relatively easy to print with. Its durability and moisture-resistant characteristics make PETG particularly suitable for applications where exposure to water is a primary concern. Alternatively, filaments made from other common materials, such as PLA or ABS, can be used for this project. However, it is important to note that the overall durability and longevity of the harvester may be compromised when compared to using PETG.
